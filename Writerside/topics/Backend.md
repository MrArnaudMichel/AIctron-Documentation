# Backend

The backend of AIctron is the part of the project that handles the processing of data using machine learning algorithms. It is responsible for reading the input data, running the machine learning models, and returning the results to the frontend. The backend is built using the Python programming language.

## Usage

1. Run the project locally

```bash
cd AIctron-Backend/code
python __init__.py
```

2. Access the project in your browser at [http://localhost:3456](http://localhost:3456)
3. Start the frontend and upload a .csv file to the project


> **Note** if you want to test the backend without the frontend, you can start the test file by running the following command:

```bash
cd AIctron-Backend
python test/__init__.py
```

4. Enjoy using AIctron!
